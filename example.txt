JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 98% of all websites (midâ€“2022) using it for this purpose.[39] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.
